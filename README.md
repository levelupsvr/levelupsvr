## About Me

I'm a Computer Science undergrad with a focus on cybersecurity who codes with curiosity and full-stack development.  
From building sleek web apps to securing systems and automating tasks with Discord bots,  
I’m always building, breaking, and learning.

I’ve contributed to college-wide platforms, led event websites, and developed tools with real impact.  
Currently leveling up across development, design, and cybersecurity—with a focus on doing things right (and a little differently).

Right now, I’m building something useful for students who like knowing exactly what they need to pass—  
turning complex calculations into simple, elegant tools.
